# StayBackend: The Airbnb Clone Project Blueprint

This project is a comprehensive simulation of a booking platform like **Airbnb**, designed to develop skills in backend system design, database management, and API security. The main goals are to build a scalable web application, understand collaborative team workflows, and apply modern software development best practices.

### Technology Stack Overview

| Technology | Purpose in the Project |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Django** | A powerful web framework well-suited for building robust and efficient RESTful APIs. |
| **MySQL** | A relational database management system used to store and organize user data, properties, and bookings. |
| **GraphQL** | An API query language that allows for precise data requests, which reduces data transfer size and improves application efficiency. |
| **Docker** | Used to package the application and its dependencies into isolated containers, ensuring it runs consistently across different environments. |
| **GitHub Actions** | An automation system within GitHub used to run tests and deploy code automatically. |

### Database Design Overview

The database design is based on a relational model that connects the core entities of the Airbnb clone.

#### Key Entities

* **Users**: Represents the application's users. Key fields: `user_id`, `name`, `email`, `password_hash`.
* **Properties**: Represents the properties available for rent. Key fields: `property_id`, `title`, `description`, `price_per_night`, `location_id`, `owner_id`.
* **Bookings**: Represents user-initiated bookings. Key fields: `booking_id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `status`.
* **Reviews**: Represents reviews left by users. Key fields: `review_id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment`.

#### Relationships

* **User to Property**: A `One-to-Many` relationship, where one user can own multiple properties.
* **User to Booking**: A `One-to-Many` relationship, where one user can make multiple bookings.
* **Property to Booking**: A `One-to-Many` relationship, where one property can have multiple bookings.
* **User to Review**: A `One-to-Many` relationship, where one user can leave multiple reviews.
* **Property to Review**: A `One-to-Many` relationship, where one property can have multiple reviews.

### Feature Breakdown

* **User Management**: This feature allows users to create accounts, log in, and update their profiles. It's essential for a secure and personalized user experience.
* **Property Management**: This feature enables property owners to add, update, and delete their listings. Itâ€™s crucial for providing an accurate and current list of available accommodations.
* **Booking System**: This is the core feature that allows users to search for properties, select dates, and complete a reservation. It ensures a smooth and reliable booking experience.
* **Reviews System**: This feature enables users to leave ratings and comments on properties after their stay. It fosters transparency and helps other users make informed decisions.

### API Security Overview

Securing the APIs is critical for protecting sensitive data and ensuring the integrity of transactions. The following security measures will be implemented:

* **Authentication**: A token-based login system will be used to verify the identity of users before they can access protected features.
* **Authorization**: User permissions will be defined to prevent unauthorized access. For example, regular users won't be able to access administrator data, and owners can only modify their own properties.
* **Rate Limiting**: This will set a maximum number of requests a user can make within a specific time frame to prevent Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks and misuse of the service.

---

### CI/CD Pipeline Overview

A CI/CD pipeline is used to automate the software development process, from code integration to deployment. Its importance in this project lies in:

* **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Automatically running tests on every code change to ensure no errors are introduced before the code is merged.
* **Continuous Delivery (CD)**: Automatically deploying successfully tested changes to a staging or production environment.

Tools like **GitHub Actions** and **Docker** will be used to automate these processes and provide a consistent, unified environment for the application.
